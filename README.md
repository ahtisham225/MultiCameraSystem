# MultiCameraSystem

Task 1: Multi-camera Setup & Recording
1.1 Collect three cameras within your home (smart phones, laptop camera etc) or from your friends,
project partners etc. In the worse case scenario you can search for a multi-camera dataset on the
web and use it for the project but that would result in deduction in marks.
1.2 Install IP Webcam app (or other similar app) on each of the smart phone
1.3 Open camera on smart phones and test the video feed on your laptop using VLC player
1.4 Use the given python and OpenCV code to record the feed from all these cameras on your hard
drive. The program should also optionally display the live feed from all three cameras.
